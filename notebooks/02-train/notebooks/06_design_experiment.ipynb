    "### Overview\n",
    "As discussed for the overall use-case, a marketing strategy is to be developed based on first-time visitors' propenisty to make a purchase during a future (return) visit to the merchandise store website. The aim of the strategy is to convert these first time visitors into customers (if they did not make a purchase during their first visit), or repeat customers (if they did make a purchase during their first visit). This covers steps 2. and 3. from a [typical A/B Testing workflow](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/data-demystified-what-is-a-b-testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "This step can be run during ML model development since it requires\n",
    "\n",
    "1. combined training+validation\n",
    "2. test\n",
    "\n",
    "data splits to be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Candidate Strategies\n",
    "Two marketing strategies to consider for first-time visitors to the store during the inference period are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. when conducting the marketing campaign, use all first-time visitors, grouped by their predicted propensity to make a purchase during a future visit, where the strategy is modified based on the group\n",
    "2. when conducting the marketing campaign, use the group of first-time visitors with the highest predicted propensity to make a purchase during a future visit, where a single strategy can be used for all visitors in the group\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group will be referred to as a marketing audience group. For the multi-group strategy (strategy 1), the groups of visitors are created based on predicted propensities. If three such groups are preferred, then the group with the visitors who are predicted to have the highest propensity to make a purchase on a return visit would be named as the *High* propensity group. Similarly, the other two groups would be named the *Medium* and *Low* propensity groups. The size of each group would be as equal as possible. For 15,000 first-time visitors, each group would consist of 5,000 visitors. Similarly, if 10 such groups are preferred then each group would consist of 1,500 visitors. The groups are created by binning the predicted propensities using their quantiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the single-group strategy (strategy 2), a single group is required. Again, the quantiles are used to create the groups (or bins or segments or buckets) of visitors based on their predicted propensity. However, only the visitors in the top group will be chosen for the marketing campaign. For the case where 10 groups (quantiles) are preferred, then only the top group is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Quantiles are Used in Each Strategy\n",
    "Regardless of the number of groups used in this strategy, a rank is assigned to each group where the lowest rank corresponds to the group with the highest predicted propensities to make a purchase on a future (return) visit. For the case where 10 groups (quantiles) are preferred, then the top group would be the one consisting of visitors with a propensity [higher than 90% of all](https://soflotutors.com/blog/what-is-a-99th-percentile-sat-score/) first-time visitors to the store during the inference data period. Similarly, the bottom group would be the one consisting of visitors with a propensity higher than 10% of all such visitors. If three groups are preferred, then the top  group captures visitors with a predicted propensity higher than 66.667% of all first-time visitors, while the visitors in the bottom group are predicted to have a propensity to make a purchase on a return visit that is higher than 33.333% of all visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating Sample Size\n",
    "Visitors placed in each group will then be randomly placed into test and control cohorts to run an A/B test for quantifying the impact of the marketing campaign. So, the sample size required for the test and control cohort must also be determined for both these strategies. The KPI to be maximized is the future conversion rate since we want visitors to become customers during a future (return) visit to the store. The required sample sizes will be estimated for a combinations of conversion rate, uplift, power and confidence level ([1](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-power-analysis-in-ab-testing-14808e8a1554), [2](https://www.abtasty.com/sample-size-calculator/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "This step will used the best ML model to estimate the size of the group, for both such strategies.\n",
    "The model will be used with the test data split (last month of data that was used during ML model development) to estimate the required size of marketing audience (test and control) cohorts for both strategies. In the next step, the same ML model will be used to predict the propensity for first-time visitors to the store during the inference period, assign these visitors to one or more audience groups based on the type of strategy (single group or multiple groups) and finally select random test and control cohorts from each group. The cohort (sample) sizes estimated in this step will be used to create the test and control cohorts in the next step."
