    "1. The accuracy of the predicted propensities are different between the `inference` and `test_split` datasets. The model performance is relatively worse on the unseen data (`inference`) compared to the data seen during development (`test_split`). Audience groups (bins) are created based on these predicted propensities. So, this ML model inaccuracy can create bins with different sizes between these two datasets. Additionally, if the number of visitors in the `inference` and `test_split` datasets are different, then this also contributes to differently sized bins. Both of these factors (inaccuracy and differently sized datasets - see the `data_size` column) are present here and this explains why the following columns\n",
