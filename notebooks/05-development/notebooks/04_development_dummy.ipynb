    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model Requirements\n",
    "In this project, ML is used to predict visitor propensity (probability) so the chosenk baseline distribution must produce a [right-skewed](https://www.statology.org/left-skewed-vs-right-skewed/) distribution (histogram) of probabilities. This would indicate that most visitors are predicted to have close to a zero percent probability of making a purchase on a return visit, which is what we saw during EDA in previous notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we have the following two requirements of a suitable baseline model for predicting visitors' propensity to make a purchase on a future visit\n",
    "1. If we use a [binary classification discrimination threshold](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/5026/17543) of 0.5, then a right-skewed histogram of probabilities will result in most visitors having a probablity of less than the threshold (0.5) meaning they would be classified as *not likely to make a purchase on a return visit to the merchandise store*. This would lead to a predicted class imbalance, which is what we want since we observed this class imbalance in the training data. However, just having a class imbalance is not enough. We need a strong class imbalance since approximately 5% of visitors were observed to make a purchase on a return visit. So, we need to modify the the skew (shape) of the baseline distribution that is chosen to match this expected class imbalance seen in the training data.\n",
    "2. Since we require probabilities, we need to choose a distribution that can be produce floating point values in the range of 0.0 to 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model Choices\n",
    "A normal distribution histogram would have a peak in the center, which would indicate that most visitors have between a 25% and 75% chance of making a return purchase, with the peak at 50%. This would not give a strongly right-skewed histogram. In turn, this would not give a strong class imbalance. So, a normal distribution is not a suitable distribution for baseline predictions of visitors' propensity to make a return purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparison, a `beta` distribution's hyperparameters (`a` and `b`) can be chosen to skew the histogram so that most customers have a low probability (propensity) to make a return purchase. This is more realistic for the current use-case and we would want to choose its hyperparameters to give a class balance of close to 95%-5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, an appropriately shaped `beta` (skewed) distribution is a suitable baseline model for the current use-case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we will generate randomly sampled predicted probablities (propensity scores) from the `beta` distribution ([1](https://byjus.com/maths/probability-distribution/), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution)) that is [strongly right skewed (positive skew)](https://www.cambridgemaths.org/blogs/skewed-usage-skewed-distribution/) using the `scipy` Python library under the `scipy.stats` module - see the [*beta distribution*](https://byjus.com/maths/beta-distribution/) documentation for the `scipy` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Approach\n",
    "During baseline model development/validation, the `a` and `b` hyperparameters of the `beta` distribution (baselline model) will be optimized using the validation data. Since this is a baseline model, model training is not required so ML features are not used. Instead, the predicted probabilities (propensities) will be randomly sampled from the `beta` distribution. As a result, the training data split will not be necessary in this notebook. The hyperparameter optimization is required so that the shape of the distribution is chosen to match the class imbalance seen in the validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "During baseline model evaluation, the `beta` distribution (baseline model) with the best hyperparameters will be used to make predictions of visitors' probabilities (propensities) of a future purchase in the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "Due to the class imbalance, evaluation metrics can be difficult to interpret. The precision will generally be very low since there are so few minority class observations in the training data (we assume this is similar to the distribution in the validation and test splits).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this constraint about class imbalance, we will choose the following metrics\n",
    "1. Area under the precision recall curve\n",
    "   - this is ideal for imbalanced data, where the priority is on maximizing the precision and recall of the minority class\n",
    "2. Uplift\n",
    "   - the first implementation is calculated as follows\n",
    "     - sort visitors in validation or test data split by predicted probability score\n",
    "       - the predicted probability score comes from the baseline model (randomly sampled values between 0 and 1 from the `beta` distribution) or ML model\n",
    "     - divide visitors into 20 percentiles (or ventiles) based on the sorted probability score\n",
    "     - calculate uplift as the ratio of the average minority class probability in the top 5% (best performing ventile) to the average minority class probability across all ventiles\n",
    "     - the interpretation of `uplift` is the factor by which the baseline or ML model is more effective than a random model\n",
    "       - here, a baseline model draws from a `beta` distribution, which will be appropriately shaped during hyperparameter optimization to have a histogram of probabilities that captures the class balance seen during EDA\n",
    "       - a random model would draw from a normal distribution, which does not have a histogram of prediction probabilities that is correctly shaped to reflect visitor buying patterns (class balance) that we saw during EDA\n",
    "       - see the above discussion about the required shape of the histogram of sampled probabilities (propensities)\n",
    "   - the second implementation, called the `lift_score`, is the ratio of correctly predicted observations in the minority class to actual number of minority obsrevations and is calculated using a conusion matrix (with hard labels)\n",
    "     - see the `mlxtend` library for the [definition of `lift_score`](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/evaluate/lift_score/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "1. The class distribution (or class balance) seen in the training data (explored during EDA) is similar to the distribution in the validation and test data splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "1. The first definition of `uplift` does not make a comparison of the predicted and true class labels. Instead, it only defines ventiles based on the predicted probability. This is acceptable since uplift is meant to compare a model's predictive power to a random model. However, this also means it is possible to have a non-zero uplift with an inaccurate model. For this reason, the other metric (area under the precision-recall curve) must also be used to evaluate model performance, in addition to `uplift`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "1. Hard predictions refer to class labels (0, 1 or `True`, `False`). Soft predictions refer to prectited probabilities (floating point values between 0 and 1).\n",
    "2. To convert soft predictions to hard labels, a fixed discrimination threshold of 0.5 will be used."

    "2. The combination that best matches the observed class balance in the validation split does not have the highest `uplift` score.\n",

    "5. Generally, as the `uplift` increases, based on the choice of hyperparameters, the predicted class imbalance also increases and approaches the true class imbalance in the validation data split. The `uplift` continues to increase as the predicted class imbalance gets worse. This may be partially due to the definition of the `uplift` score or choice of number of percentiles (here, we used 20) - future work should look into why this observation was seen."

    "1. With such a strong class imbalance, even small changes to the imbalance requires changes in the baseline model hyperparameters. The best baseline model effectively replicated the imbalance of the validation data but it does not generalize to changes in the class imbalance (as is seen in the test data). The poor generalizability is seen in the worse (lower) ML metrics during model evaluation compared to model validation with the best hyperparameters. The baseline model has no input features to learn changes in the underlying features (attributes about visits) between the validation and test data splits. Although it has adequately predicted the validation split labels, it has not gained any knowledge that translates into the test split. This is the limitation of a baseline model."

    "1. The true average class imbalance ratio is in the range of 20 to 25 (or, 20:1 to 25:1). There are six sub-categories in the `true_class_imbalance` column, out of a total of 13 that were selected, that have a true class-imbalance ratio of more than 100 and that is outside this range. By comparison, the predicted class imbalance stays in the range of approximately 19 to 22. As we saw earlier, this baseline model has not learnt from inputs (features) so it is largely insensitive to changes in features and is the primary reason for this discrepancy in ranges.\n",

    "   - within each feature\n",
    "     - agree with eachother for the `bounces` feature but disagree for others\n",
    "       - compare the `rank_lift_score_by_feature` and `rank_uplift_by_feature` columns\n",
    "   - across all sub-categories\n",

    "       - compare the `rank_lift_score` and `rank_uplift` columns\n",
    "3. During hyperparameter tuning, the `pr_auc` and `precision` metrics did not change much as hyperparameters of the baseline model were changed. Here, the same two metrics show more sensitivity to the choice of sub-category. By reading through the rows of the `precision`, `pr_auc`, `true_class_imbalance`, `predicted_class_imbalance` and `feature` columns, we can say that based on these two metrics, the model's performance is qualitatively worse than the average across all selected sub-categories for the following\n",

    "1. A single choice of skewed distribution (`beta`) was used to represent the baseline model. This was chosen since it can sample values in the range of 0 to 1, which is the range of prediction probabilities that we want for a binary classification model.\n",
    "2. For the `uplift` evaluation metric, ventiles (20 bins) were used. However, other binning approaches (deciles, which would give 10 bins) were not explored.\n",
    "3. The first definition of `uplift` does not make a comparison of the predicted and true class labels. Instead, it only defines ventiles based on the predicted probability. This is acceptable since uplift is meant to compare a model's predictive power to a random model. However, this also means it is possible to have a non-zero uplift with an inaccurate model. For this reason, the other metric (area under the precision-recall curve) must also be used to evaluate model performance, in addition to `uplift`.\n",
    "4. The baseline model does not learn from features so its hyperparameters were only chosen based on its ability to match the class imbalance seen in the validation data split. This does not generalize to unseen data with a different class imbalance, but this is adequate for a baseline model."
