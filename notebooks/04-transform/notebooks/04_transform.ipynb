    "### Objective\n",
    "This step of the analysis prepares data for ML model training. Training, validation and test data splits are created in order to support training a ML model to predict the propensity of new visitors to the Google Merchandise store on the Google Marketplace to make a purchase on a future visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Data Transformation\n",
    "The raw data in the dataset is provided per visit. The ML model needs to be trained to make predictions at the visit level for each visitor who made a purchase on a return visit to the store. However, useful features might exist based on\n",
    "\n",
    "1. actions performed by a visitor within each visit\n",
    "   - number of items that were added to a shopping cart during the first visit\n",
    "   - whether a purchase was completed on the first visit\n",
    "   - etc.\n",
    "2. device used by the visitor during the visit\n",
    "\n",
    "All actions performed per visit are found in a nested column `hits` for each visit so the raw data for this column must be exploded from one row per visit to one row per action in order to extract these action-based features. Exploding a nested row is similar to the `.explode()` `DataFrame` in `pandas` ([link](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.explode.html#pandas.DataFrame.explode)). Then, the data is aggregated again by visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploding the `hits` column results in multiple rows where the sequence of actions is important. Features can be created based on this sequence. As an example, if a visit ended in an item(s) being added to the shopping cart, then the last action performed in the visit is a add-to-cart (encoded as an integer `3`). So, a feature will be created to indicate that last action of each visit and this requires exploding the `hits` column, which is a nested column. Similarly, to get the browser used during a visit, a nested value `device.browser` needs to be extracted from the `device` column. Exploding the `device` column is not necessary for this purpose, since the there is only one browser used per visit (per the definition of a visit) so, when exploded, all rows for the visit contain the same browser. `hits` is a nested column in the data since it contains a list of dictionaries, while `device` is a dictionary. We can just directly access `device.browser` from the nested `device` column, which is [supported by `BigQuery`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated#define_nested_and_repeated_columns). For this reason, only the `hits` column in the raw data needs to be exploded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested columns are exploded are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `hits`\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested columns that are used without exploding are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `totals`\n",
    "2. `trafficSource`\n",
    "3. `device`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "Features are selected based on\n",
    "\n",
    "1. EDA performed in previous step\n",
    "2. intuition about features that might be predictive of a new visitor making a purchase on a future visit to the Merchandise store\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the types of features that are selected\n",
    "1. User-Facing Features\n",
    "   - name of browser\n",
    "   - type of operating system (one of Windows, Mac, Linux)\n",
    "   - [referring channel](https://www.jellyfish.com/en-us/training/blog/google-analytics-channels-explained)\n",
    "   - type of device\n",
    "2. General Features\n",
    "   - hits\n",
    "   - bounces\n",
    "   - page views\n",
    "   - time spent on the Marketplace website\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, in order to get these columns, we have developed the following approach in previous steps and the same will be used here\n",
    "\n",
    "1. get visitors who made a purchase on their return visit (this comes from the query immediately above)\n",
    "2. Get all features for the first visit (`totals.newVisits = 1`) for all visitors\n",
    "3. `INNER JOIN` features with the visitors who made a purchase on their return visit\n",
    "   - this provides the features for only the visitors who made a purchase on their return visit, since we are not interested in using data for visitors who did not make a purchase on their return visit\n",
    "4. `GROUP BY` visit and get the last action that was performed in that visit\n",
    "   - ML modeling will be performed against data at the visit level since we need to predict propensity to make a purchase during a future visit\n",
    "   - the `UNNEST` function has exploded nested actions per visit on separate rows, so the exploded data in the `first_visit_attributes` CTE is per action\n",
    "   - since the ML model will be trained on visits, a `GROUP BY` is required to convert actions into visits\n",
    "   - since we are only retrieving the first visit for reach visitor (from 2. above), getting the last action that was performed in that visit indicates how far the visitor advanced in the purchase process during their first visit to the marketplace\n",
    "     - intuitively, this seems like it could be an indicator of whether the visitor will make a purchase on a return visit to the Google Merchandise store\n",
    "   - a unique visit is defined by the combination of the following columns\n",
    "     - `fullvisitorid`\n",
    "     - `visitId`\n",
    "     - `visitNumber`\n",
    "     - `visitStartTime`\n",
    "\n",
    "     and so a `GROUP BY` must be performed over these columns. The following columns are included as part of the definition of a visit\n",
    "\n",
    "     - columns of aggregated stats per visit\n",
    "       - `hits`\n",
    "       - `bounces`\n",
    "       - `pageviews`\n",
    "       - `time_on_site`\n",
    "     - columns showing features of the traffic source that initiated a visitor's visit\n",
    "       - `source`\n",
    "       - `medium`\n",
    "       - `channelGrouping`\n",
    "     - columns with features of the visitor's device used during a visit\n",
    "       - `browser`\n",
    "       - `os` (operating system)\n",
    "       - `deviceCategory` (Windows, Mac or Linux)\n",
    "     - (as mentioned above) the label column is reported per visit\n",
    "       - `made_purchase_on_future_visit`\n",
    "\n",
    "     These are columns that only change at the visit level, so we have grouped over these columns. See the two previous steps (data preparation and EDA) for more details about the structure of this SQL query to retrieve these features from the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Processing\n",
    "Without any reduction in cardinality, the `source` and `os` (operating system) columns present the biggest problem due to their large number of unique sub-categories. If one-hot encoding is used to transform the categorical features in the training data, then tree-based models will perform poorly since the one-hot encoded data will be sparse. Bucketing to reduce the cardinality will help the performance of tree-based models. `XGBoost` has specific guidance to handle categorical data ([1](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/categorical.html#categorical-data), [2](https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-preparation-gradient-boosting-xgboost-python/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid categorical features with a high cardinality, we have only kept the most common categories for each categorical feature. A generic category of `Other` was assigned to all other (less commonly occurring) categories. A bucketing strategy, where all categories accounting for less than 5% or 10% of all observations per categorical have been grouped into the same bucket strongly reduced the cardinality in the training data and will again be used in this step. In the data preparation step, this approach was called frequency encoding and its main disadvantage is that the predictive power of such a feature might be reduced by such a bucketing approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The raw data from the `BigQuery` table, that was used in the preceding (EDA) step, is again used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeframe for Study\n",
    "For the entire project, we have assumed that the current date is March 1, 2017. The data splits to be created are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. training\n",
    "   - September 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016\n",
    "2. validation\n",
    "   - January 1, 2017 to January 31, 2017\n",
    "3. test\n",
    "   - February 1, 2017 to February 28, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned in the data preparation step, during ML model development, we are only choosing first-time visitors who made a purchase on a return visit to the store between September 1, 2016 and February 31, 2017. This means each selected visitor initially visited the store starting on September 1, 2016. During this first visit, they may or may not have made a purchase. The same visitor also made a return visit to the store during which they made a purchase. This return visit is allowed to occur no later than February 28, 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, in the\n",
    "\n",
    "1. training data\n",
    "   - each visitor made their first visit as early as September 1, 2016\n",
    "     - this first visit gives us the ML features (`X`)\n",
    "   - each such visitor could have made a return visit, in which they made a purchase, as late as February 28, 2017\n",
    "     - the outcome of this future visit (purchase or no purchase) gives us the ML label (`y`)\n",
    "     - since today is March 1, 2017, we know the label (`y`) for all these visitors\n",
    "       - for this reason, when we prepare our data for ML development, our data preparation does not suffer from data leakage/lookahead bias (this was also discussed in the preceding two steps - data preparation and EDA)\n",
    "     - note that each such visitor only needs to make a purchase on one or more future visits before February 28, 2017\n",
    "2. validation data\n",
    "   - each visitor made their first visit as early as January 1, 2017\n",
    "   - each such visitor could have made a return visit, in which they made a purchase, as late as February 28, 2017\n",
    "3. test data\n",
    "   - each visitor made their first visit as early as February 1, 2017\n",
    "   - each such visitor could have made a return visit, in which they made a purchase, as late as February 28, 2017\n",

    "   - we will want to consider random [undersampling, or downsampling](https://machinelearningmastery.com/random-oversampling-and-undersampling-for-imbalanced-classification/) to improve the imbalance ratio from approximately 20:1 in favor of the majority class to a ratio such as 10:1 or 5:1. This will help the ML model in two ways\n",
    "     - reducing the degree of imbalance will learn from a relatively larger number of positive examples (visitor did make a purchase on a future visit - we are interested in these visitors) than in the raw data which will have a larger number negative examples (visitor did not make a purchase on a future visit - we are not interested in these visitors for the current business use-case)\n",
    "     - keeping the true class imbalance is also inefficient in terms of training time since the model spends most of its time learning from uninteresting examples\n",

    "1. Earlier, it was mentioned that `totals.newVisits = 1` gives the first visit while `totals.newVisits = NULL` gives the future visit. In the training data, the first visit was picked up using this filter condition as a SQL filter. This allowed features from the first visit to be extracted. The label was whether the visitor made a purchase during their return visit. Here, the validation data uses the same approach. Per the business use-case, we want to predict new visitor's propensity of making a purchase during their return (or future) visit.\n",

The label of the validation data is analogous to that from the training data in that it indicates whether these new visitors (in the validation data split) made a purchase during a future visit.\n",

Visitor ID will not be used as a feature during training, validation or evaluation (test data).

    "     - exploratory data analysis preformed in the preceding step\n",
    "     - intuition about factors that would be predictive of a new visitor's propensity (probability) of making a purchase on a future visit to the store\n",
    "   - It might be best to start by training a ML model with one of the General Features (`time_on_site`, `hits`, `pageviews`) and only add more if necessary to improve performance\n",

    "   - approaches to process features were adopted based on frequencies observed in the training data during the EDA step\n",
    "     - categorical features were bucketed\n",
    "   - based on analysis in the current step\n",
