## [About](#about)

Modeling visitor propensity to make purchase during return visit to the Google merchandise store, to create a marketing audience based on propensity-based groupings. This is intended to help a marketing team target high-value first-time visitors to the store's site during a one-month period with promotions through a campaign aimed at ensuring a conversion (the visitor makes a purchase) when they return to the store.

See `index.qmd` for project details.
